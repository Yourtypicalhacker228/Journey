## 🚀 About Me

I’m a driven student fueled by curiosity and purpose. Although financial constraints prevented me from sitting for the CEH and CCT certification exams, I’ve acquired hands-on experience through intensive training and platforms like TryHackMe, Coursera, and Forage’s job simulations—and I’m hungry to put those skills to work.
 
## 🎯 Objective
To launch my cybersecurity career by joining a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, with a focus on threat detection, incident response, and continuous learning.

## 🧾 Certifications

💡Due to financial constraints, I wasn’t able to sit for the CEH, CCT and CCNA certification exams. 
However, that hasn’t stopped me from actively mastering the core competencies through self-study, hands-on labs, and real-world job simulations. Platforms like TryHackMe, Forage, and Coursera have given me extensive practical exposure to threat detection, incident response, and the tools used in modern SOC environments.
